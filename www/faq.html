				<h1><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h1>
				<p>These FAQs allow a deeper insight to the essence of what OA STEM is and what exactly we do. Most of the questions everyone asks us goes here, and so we hope, by reading through this section, your questions will all be answered. If not, you can always attend our meetings to learn about us firsthand and ask us questions in person - or, you can always e-mail us at <a href="mailto:contact@oastem.org">contact@oastem.org</a>.</p>
				<div id="faqQuestions">
					<h3><a href="#">What is OA STEM?</a></h3>
					<div><p>Oxford Academy STEM is a student-run pathway apart from health and business. We have five departments based on each letter of STEM: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, with Marketing supporting the main four. We help students learn more and experience Science, Tech,  Engineering, and Math through competitions with other schools.</p></div>

					<h3><a href="#">How are the departments different?</a></h3>
					<div><p>Each department has a different focus, and compete in different events with the exception of Tech and Engineering, which collaborate on making robots. Each department functions almost independently as well, but share the same pool of resources.</p></div>
					
					<h3><a href="#">Can you join multiple departments?</a></h3>
					<div><p>Yes, in fact joining multiple departments is encouraged. However, you will have to choose one department that's your main focus in case any conflicts arise.</p></div>

					<h3><a href="#">What do the departments do?</a></h3>
					<div><p>Each department gives you the opportunity to learn more about either Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. In order to make sure there's a goal involved though instead of just a bunch of students meeting every once in a while, each department competes against other schools in competitions related to STEM, like building robots or doing science experiments.</p></div>
					
					<h3><a href="#">What kind of stuff do we learn in the Science Department?</a></h3>
					<div><p>The Science Department involves a lot: all of science, from physics to biology to chemistry to even subjects you don't usually get in school anymore, like geology or astronomy. Two events, Science Bowl and Science Olympiad, test your general knowledge of all science, but in different ways. Science Bowl is a team-based Jeopardy-style competition, whereas Science Olympiad involves doing demos like chemistry experiments and taking a multiple choice test. </p></div>
					
					<h3><a href="#">The Technology Department?</a></h3>
					<div><p>If you're interested in anything related to computers, this is it. The Technology Department covers everything from hardware - computer engineering (hard drives, RAM, power supplies and the like) - to software, from programming to web design. Tech is responsible for programming the robots The Engineering Department works on; they provide the body and Tech makes the brains. Tech is also responsible for maintaining OA STEM's website, from the graphics to the tech it runs on.</p></div>
					
					<h3><a href="#">The Engineering Department?</a></h3>
					<div>
						<p>The Engineering Department is strictly limited to mechanical and electrical engineering; no chemical or biomedical involved. If that's something you're interested in, you should probably join Science Department instead.</p>
						<p>Engineering focuses mainly on the task of building robots of all sizes that are designed to meet a specific task set out by competition organizers which usually involves scoring points.</p>
						<p>Sorry, but no BattleBots involved.</p>
					</div>

					<h3><a href="#">The Math Department?</a></h3>
					<div><p>There's not really any other way to show off your math skills than to sit down and take a test on it. But, math competitions like the AMC don't test hard topics; a general knowledge of geometry (or even better - trigonometry) is usually more than enough. The questions are designed to be tricky but not hard and boring; they're more worried about how you think - outside of the box - than how much math you've memorized. You just have to think different.</p></div>

					<h3><a href="#">Why join this club?</a></h3>
					<div>
						<p>If you're interested in being a scientist, mathematician, or engineer, there's no other club or team at Oxford that gives you the same amount of opportunities as we do. Just saying science is your favorite class is one thing - getting to actually build your own robot or do your own experiments is something else entirely.</p>
						<p>We also have mentors from JPL. You know the guys who landed the Curiosity rover on Mars? Yeah. Them.</p>
					</div>

					<h3><a href="#">How will this club help me?</a></h3>
					<div><p>Learn more about science, not just the stuff in chem or bio. We don't have an engineering class, AP Comp Sci only scratches the surface, and where else do you get to learn about astronomy and geology? There are also plenty of scholarships involved, and competing in these nationwide competitions looks good on college apps too.</p></div>

					<h3><a href="#">Is this the same as RobEn?</a></h3>
					<div><p>Oxford Academy STEM happened after Robotics and Math Club merged and added on a few new parts. Rob-En, the old Robotics Club, is definitely a core part of STEM, but since RobEn used to stand for the old club name, Oxford Academy Robotics and Engineering, we've calling our robotics team something different now too: Quantum Leap. Sounds cool, doesn't it?</p></div>

					<h3><a href="#">Can I get an officer position?</a></h3>
					<div><p>All the officer positions this year have been filled, unfortunately, but there's no reason why any member (that isn't a senior, of course) can't be president next year! You just have to show your dedication, talent, and, most importantly, the desire to try something new. OA STEM's grown very quickly over just a few months of summer, after all.</p></div>

					<h3><a href="#">What if I don't have experience?</a></h3>
					<div><p>Then you'll get some by joining STEM! While experience definitely helps, we're not looking for experience so much as a willingness to learn.</p></div>

					<h3><a href="#">Can anybody join, or do they have to get selected?</a></h3>
					<div>
						<p>We'll take anyone's application, but since we only have so many materials, we can't accept the entire student body. Engineering is limited to how many robots we can make, Tech to many computers we have, Science to how many slots the competition give us, but Math and Marketing can take as many as we feel comfortable having. It's not fun to just be sitting around doing nothing, so we think that if we have to do that, well, there's something more fun and productive you could be doing instead.</p>
						<p>We choose who to accept based on your paper application and a trial period with us, so work hard on that app and pay attention in person. First impressions count!</p>
					</div>

					<h3><a href="#">Even junior high?</a></h3>
					<div><p>Yeah! In fact, depending on demand for it, we'll even have a robotics competition dedicated solely for junior high students based on LEGOs! So if you're interested, make sure you let us know!</p></div>

					<h3><a href="#">How time consuming are the club and its separate departments?</a></h3>
					<div><p>We expect that it'll be one of your top commitments, after school and alongside sports. Engineering and Tech especially are very time consuming - building robots is hard work, after all.</p></div>
