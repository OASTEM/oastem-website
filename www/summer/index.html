			<h1><span>STEM Summer</span></h1>
			<p>Oxford Academy STEM is a year round program - we don't stop when school stops. During the summer, we utilize the time to learn things we don't have time for during the school year. It is uncommon to be interested and involved in all four departments so we allow students to pick and choose which department meetings they want to go to, whether it be only one department, or all four.</p>
            <p>Meetings for the 2015 summer season start on the week of <strong>$firstWeek</strong> and last until <strong>$lastWeek</strong> in room <strong>$room</strong>. Since we have more time in the summer than a normal school day, instead of meeting for 60-90 minutes, each department will have a full three hour class each week from <strong>9:00AM to 12:00PM</strong>. Each department meets on a different day so be sure to check out the information listed below.</p>
            <p>If you're are actually interested in knowing what will go on in each meeting, continue reading to find out more, or choose a specific department to skip to: <a href="#science">Science</a>, <a href="#technology">Technology</a>, <a href="#engineering">Engineering</a>, and <a href="#math">Mathematics</a>.</p>
